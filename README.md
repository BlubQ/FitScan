## Description
Ship scanners in EVE Online do not show the entirety of a ship's fit on a single run. This tool helps automatically compile the fits into an easy to see solution, with the ability to export the fit once you are done.

**Features:**
* Ability to scan ships and build a fit
* Automatic clipboard reading, no need to switch tabs!
* choose a ship to know when you have filled all slots
* Easy fitting export by copying to clipboard
